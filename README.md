A powerful visual automation workflow builder that allows you to create complex workflows without writing code. Build automation flows with triggers, data sources, logic blocks, and actions - all through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

Features

- Drag-and-drop interface built with React Flow
- Node Types:
  - Triggers: Manual, Schedule (cron), Webhook
  - Data Sources: Weather API, GitHub, Google Calendar, HTTP requests
  - Logic: Filter, Transform, Conditional branching, AI/LLM processing
  - Actions: Email, SMS, Webhooks, Social media posting, Notifications
- Topological sorting for correct execution order
- SQLite database for workflow storage
- Real-time Configuration: Configure each node with a dynamic config panel
- Data Flow: Pass data between nodes seamlessly

Quick Start

Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

Installation

1. Clone the repository

   bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd visual-workflow

2. Install dependencies

   bash
   npm install

3. Set up the database

   bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma migrate dev

Development

Run the development server:

bash
npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Build for Production

bash
npm run build
npm start

Usage

Creating Your First Workflow

1. Click "Create Workflow" from the workflows page
2. Give your workflow a name and description
3. You'll be taken to the visual editor

Building a Workflow

1. Add Nodes: Drag nodes from the left panel onto the canvas
2. Connect Nodes: Click and drag from the bottom of one node to the top of another
3. Configure Nodes: Click on a node to open its configuration panel
   - Set parameters like API endpoints, email addresses, conditions, etc.
   - Give nodes custom labels
4. Save: Click the "Save" button in the top toolbar
5. Execute: Click "Run Workflow" to execute your automation

Example Workflows

Daily Weather Briefing

Schedule (9:00 AM) → Weather Data (Location) → Email (Send report)

GitHub Activity Digest

Schedule (Weekly) → GitHub (Commits) → Transform → Email

Smart Notifications

Data Source → Filter (Condition) → Email/SMS/Notification

Configuration

Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory (optional - for external integrations):

```env
# Email Service (for email actions)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

# Weather API (for weather data nodes)
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key

# GitHub API (for GitHub data nodes)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token

# OpenAI API (for AI logic nodes)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Google Gemini (for AI logic nodes)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Google Cloud (for Calendar and Sheets)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_service_account_email
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n..."
```

Note: The application works without these API keys - it will use mock data and simulations. Add keys only for production use.

Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with three main models:

- Workflow: Stores workflow metadata (name, description, active status)
- Node: Individual nodes in a workflow (type, subtype, config, position)
- Connection: Edges connecting nodes (source, target, handles)
